 ### < ABOUT  ME> 

    Victor Jacob Asuquo, Python/Machine Learning Instructor at Start Innovation Hub, Uyo - Nigeria 

    An Open source Contributor, passionate and inquisitive python Engineer who brings wealth of expertise in crafting cutting-edge solutions that transcend industries and drive business success. I am eager to learn and share the know I have about Python programming and communities.

    At the moment I am Working on an open source Library, a beginner friendly library that allows beginners to dive into the world of python Data Science and Machine Learning. The Library allows user to generate sales Dataset and do some manipulations with the  dataset and learn Data Science faster. Although the library is not yet published, It will be made public as soon as possible.

### < EDUCATION >
    Currently Pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering at University of Uyo, Nigeria

### < SESSION DETAILS >
     TOPIC: CodeLab: Precision Engineering for Machine Learning   

### < DESCRIPTION>
    As we all know about the World of AI Automating different Task and making it easier to the things perceived to be difficult. However, Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence Generally is based on data. In some cases we observed Machine Learning Models being biased and performing poorly when used. How do you boost the performance and Accuracy of Machine Learning Models leveraging Log Loss, Gradient Descent, Cost Function, Vectorization, Feature Engineering, sigmoid function etc. Using the right Matrix for your model is critical.

    In this practical Codelab session we will dive into the basics of building Machine Learning
    Models with an increased performance using the techniques mentioned earlier using Jupyter notebook. 


### < CONCLUSION >
    I believe Given the oppurtunity we can leverage the oppurtuinity to do Great things.
